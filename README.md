# Getting Started

These GitHub repositories contain open source projects and demonstrations
that do interesting things with STEP, STEP-NC, and IFC information.  Most 
of them use the ST-Developer libraries or the STEP-NC Machine DLL, which
have downloadable versions that are free for personal use.
